## Description

Refactoring a completed site for accessibility, more intuitive styling, and coding readability without effecting the presentation. The site started without semantic elements, hurting accessability and SEO. Semantic elements make the code easier to read, and allows web crawlers to more easily index websites.

After refactoring the HTML, the CSS was updated and streamlined to make future style changes much easier.
